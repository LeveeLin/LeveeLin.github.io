# üë®‚Äçüéì About Me
I am currently focusing on **TPMS lattice structure, Mechanical metamaterials and Additive manufacturing**, as I pursue my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical design, manufacture & its automation at the School of Transportation and Logistics Engineering, Wuhan University of Technology. Presently, I'm conducting researches on Effects of volume fraction and interlacing number on Ti6Al4V multicell interlacing Gyroid TPMS lattice structures supervised by [Prof. Lei Yang(Êù®Á£ä)](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lei-Yang-129). In August, I will follow [Chair Prof. Yu Wang(ÁéãÁÖú)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=Oo7c22wAAAAJ) to conducte researches on topology optimization of TPMS and additive manufacturing.

I have been awarded the Second-class Scholarship twice, in 2022 and 2023, and was hornored as one of the "Top Graduates of the Class of 2024" at my school. 

My research journey began with the structural design of Triply period minimal surfaces(TPMS) and additive manufacturing when I was a sophomore. I held the belif that additive manufacturing can significantly shape the development of global economy, as this technique allows for production of architectures with extremely complicated shapes using fewer raw materials. 

You can find my CV here: [Di Lin's CV](CV.pdf).

Team Members: **Di Lin**, Cong Zhang, Xiyong Chen, Nannan Wang, Lei Yang*.

**Description**: 
- Our team developed the TPMS_Scaffold_Generator, a software tool designed to generate various TPMS lattice structures. This tool enables researchers to conduct comprehensive investigations into the geometrical, mechanical, thermal, and vibrational properties of these structures.
- Our research focused on the compressive mechanical behavior of Ti-6Al-4V Fischer-Koch TPMS lattice structures with different gradients, fabricated using Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF). Additionally, I introduced an innovative design for TPMS lattice structures, termed multi-symmetrical TPMS scaffolds with varying orientations.
